# International preprint checklist (EN)

## 1) Files & formatting

- [ ] Main PDF export ready (title, author, abstract, keywords)
- [ ] Figures render correctly in the target venue
- [ ] Math rendering checked (avoid common pitfalls like `t^*_1`; prefer `t_1^{\ast}`; avoid unescaped braces that break KaTeX/GitHub)
- [ ] Spelling and terminology consistent (use “tempo” consistently; do not mix “tempo” and “speed” unless explicitly defined)

## 2) Licensing & statements

- [ ] License declared (CC BY 4.0)
- [ ] Competing interests declared (none)
- [ ] Ethics statement (no human subjects; no personal data)
- [ ] AI assistance disclosure (if required by venue)

## 3) Links & reproducibility

- [ ] GitHub repo link works
- [ ] Zenodo DOI link works
- [ ] Any mirror repo link works (optional)
- [ ] Quickstart notebook link works

## 4) Scientific posture

- [ ] Tier-2 case studies pass the A/B/C novelty filter (see `tier2_predictions_register.en.md`)
- [ ] Estimators and thresholds are pre-registered before running experiments
- [ ] Negative results are reported, not hidden
