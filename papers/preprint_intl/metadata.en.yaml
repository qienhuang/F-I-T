title:
  en: "Tempo as a First-Class Safety Variable: Identifying Irreversible Operations (IOs) in AI Deployment via Minimum Viable Tempo Governance (MVTG)"

abstract:
  en: >
    Deployment risks of generative AI increasingly manifest as system-level irreversibility: when update tempo outpaces evaluation, audit,
    and rollback capacity, systems may remain performant while becoming structurally hard to correct. This work treats tempo as a first-class
    safety variable and introduces Irreversible Operations (IOs)—actions that permanently shrink the feasible option space for future correction
    (e.g., tempo escalation, rollback erosion, control transfer, and dependency collapse). We propose auditable, low-cost indicators with provisional
    thresholds (update-to-evaluation ratio, rollback rehearsal success rate, decision auditability) and a deployable control layer, Minimum Viable
    Tempo Governance (MVTG), which governs only actions crossing irreversibility thresholds to preserve intervention viability. The approach is
    architecture-agnostic and targets operational interfaces rather than model internals.
