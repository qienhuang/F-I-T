Single-cell RNA sequencing enables high-resolution trajectory reconstruction, yet prevailing interpretations remain state-centric: differential expression is routinely treated as evidence of fate commitment. This conflates transient expression variation with irreversible structural change.

We propose a constraint-centric reframing using the Force--Information--Time (FIT) framework. Fate commitment corresponds to contraction and reconfiguration of the reachable expression space, not expression levels alone. We introduce a Tier-2, estimator-gated protocol comprising: (i) formal boundary and estimator family declaration; (ii) coherence-gated constraint measurement; (iii) phase-conditional interpretation; and (iv) multi-signal registration of commitment points.

The protocol is designed to produce auditable artifacts (coherence reports, fail-window indices, and registered commitment points) rather than post hoc marker narratives. Coherence-gated failures are treated as estimator-family mismatch or scope limitation, not as a reason to force interpretation. This reframing shifts single-cell biology from ``what changes in expression'' to ``what becomes unreachable in expression space''.
