# AGI Essays

This subseries explores AGI development with and without FIT as a system-level engineering discipline.

These texts are conceptual and methodological essays. They do not define binding FIT semantics, estimator claims, or deployment rules.

## Scope

Focus areas:

- world models and spatial intelligence
- closed-loop stability and temporal diagnostics
- constraint engineering and failure taxonomies
- auditable progress for high-consequence systems

## Reading Order

1. [`00_agi_without_and_with_fit.md`](00_agi_without_and_with_fit.md) - Why AGI can progress without FIT, but why progress may remain non-diagnosable.
2. [`01_agi_engineering_path.md`](01_agi_engineering_path.md) - A practical engineering path for loop metrics, constraint regimes, and risk instrumentation.
