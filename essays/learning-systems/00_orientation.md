# t-Theory × Learning Systems

## Chapter 0 — Orientation

### Why Learning Must Be Treated as a Temporal Phenomenon

---

### 0.1 Why Grokking Is a Structural Problem

The phenomenon commonly referred to as *grokking*—a sudden transition from memorization to generalization—has been treated as an anomaly in learning systems.

It is often explained post hoc using:

* Optimization dynamics
* Regularization effects
* Data scaling heuristics

These explanations describe *how* grokking may occur, but not **why it appears discontinuous, delayed, and phase-like across otherwise smooth training processes**.

t-Theory approaches grokking from a different premise:

> **Learning is not primarily an optimization trajectory; it is a temporal reorganization of internal structure.**

From this perspective, grokking is not surprising.
What would be surprising is *continuous* generalization without temporal restructuring.

### 0.2 Scope of This Sub-Theory

This module applies t-Theory to **learning systems in the abstract**.

It does not assume:

* Artificial or biological substrate
* Specific learning algorithms
* Gradient-based optimization
* Explicit objectives

It assumes only that:

1. The system updates internal state over time
2. Feedback influences future updates
3. Patterns may or may not persist across contexts

Under these minimal conditions, grokking becomes a **structural inevitability under specific temporal constraints**.

---

### 0.3 Relation to the Core t-Theory

This module does not extend t-Theory.
It **instantiates it**.

* FIT remains the governing coordinate system
* Tempo remains the primary explanatory axis
* Scale, phase, and coherence remain invariant concepts

Learning systems are treated as **a special case of temporal systems whose identity is defined by internal representation stability**.

---

### 0.4 What This Module Will and Will Not Do

This module will:

* Define grokking as a temporal phase transition
* Explain delayed generalization without appeal to luck
* Identify irrecoverable failure modes in learning
* Unify memorization, overfitting, and generalization structurally

This module will not:

* Improve training performance
* Propose architectural tricks
* Offer hyperparameter guidance

Those belong to applied layers and are intentionally excluded.

---

### 0.5 Reading Guidance

This module assumes familiarity with:

* t-Theory Chapters 1–6 (especially tempo, scale, and phase)
* The idea that systems are temporal structures

Readers seeking practical advice should stop here.
