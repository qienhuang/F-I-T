# Essays — Conceptual Motivations Behind FIT

This directory contains **non-technical, non-binding philosophical essays**
that record the conceptual intuitions behind the development of the
F-I-T (Force–Information–Time) framework.

These texts are intentionally **free of formulas, estimators, and falsifiable claims**.

---

## Status and Intent

The essays in this directory:

- are **not technical papers**
- are **not formal components** of the FIT framework
- do **not** define primitives, propositions, or semantics
- do **not** impose usage constraints

They exist to capture **conceptual motivation, cross-domain intuition,
and long-horizon reasoning** that preceded and accompanied later
technical work.

## Relationship to FIT (Public Layer)

All **binding** definitions, rules, and claims live outside this directory.

In particular:

- Formal semantics are defined in `CHARTER.md`
- Public navigation is defined in `MANIFEST.md`
- Technical usage is indexed in `domains/` (applied indexes) and `lenses/` (structural templates)
- Falsifiable structure is documented in `overview/`

If any statement in these essays conflicts with the public FIT specification,
the specification **always prevails**.

---

## What These Essays Are For

These essays are intended to:

- provide intuition for readers new to FIT
- preserve the original conceptual trajectory behind the framework
- support cross-domain reflection where formalization is premature
- act as a **conceptual companion** to later technical material

They may be cited as **conceptual background**, but not as technical evidence.

---

## What These Essays Are Not For

These essays must **not** be used to:

- justify policy, governance, or coercive decisions
- substitute for estimator-bound analysis
- claim predictive or normative authority
- infer formal properties of the FIT framework

Such usage is out of scope.

---

## Contents

Typical topics include:

- why optimization-centric explanations often fail
- why timing and constraint structure dominate raw force
- parallels between learning, economics, governance, and technology
- intuition behind late-time stability, lock-in, and collapse

Individual essays may explore these themes freely and narratively.

---

## Citation and Use

If you reference these essays:

- treat them as **conceptual or philosophical material**
- do not attribute formal claims to them
- cite the corresponding FIT version separately if relevant

These essays are published to **preserve intellectual continuity**, not to
establish formal authority.

## License and Versioning

Unless stated otherwise, essays follow the repository license.

They are versioned independently from the FIT public layer.

## Long-Form Explorations

Some topics are explored in depth across multiple chapters:

- `essays/learning-systems/`
- `essays/governance-longform/`
- `essays/technology-longform/`

These materials are exploratory and philosophical in nature.
