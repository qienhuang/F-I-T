# How to Help Without Hurting: A Practical Toolbox for Depression and Addiction

*A companion to “Why Helping Often Hurts” — written for family and friends*

If you read Part 1, you already know the paradox: **your care can become pressure**—and pressure can make someone who’s depressed or trapped in addiction sink deeper.

This Part 2 is not an essay. It’s a **toolbox**: scripts, checklists, and “do-this-tonight” moves that reduce harm and keep doors from closing.

You don’t need perfect insight. You need **repeatable, low-pressure actions**.

## How to use this (jump navigation)

* **If you have 2 minutes:** read **Five Things** + **Tonight Checklist**
* **If they’re shut down / rejecting everything:** go to **Toolbox A + B**
* **If they’re fragile / easily overwhelmed:** go to **Toolbox C**
* **If there’s a small spark:** go to **Toolbox D**
* **If relapse risk is high tonight:** go to **Toolbox E**
* **If the family is swarming them:** go to **Toolbox F**
* **If you are panicking:** go to **Toolbox G**

## Ground rules (read once)

**1) Safety overrides everything.**
If there’s risk of self-harm, overdose, violence, or they can’t stay basically safe, stop here and get professional help immediately (crisis line, emergency services/ER, clinician, trusted family). Don’t carry it alone.

**2) This is not therapy or medical advice.**
This is a helper’s toolbox for **reducing pressure** and **preventing irreversible damage**.

**3) Withdrawal can be medically dangerous.**
Withdrawal from **alcohol** or **benzodiazepines** can be life-threatening. If dependence is possible, seek medical guidance before abrupt stopping.

**4) States change. Don’t label the person.**
“Locked / Fragile / Restartable” are **temporary states**, not identities. Use them to guide *your* pressure level.
**Do not tell them “you’re Locked/Fragile.”** That turns a helper tool into a label.

**5) When in doubt, default to pressure reduction.**
If you’re not sure what to do, the safest move is usually: remove weight, reduce expectation, avoid irreversible decisions.

## If you only do five things, do these

1. **Ask:** “Do you want company, or help solving something?”
2. **Offer two choices, not ten:** “Food or a walk?” “Laundry or a call?”
3. **Start a 7-day pause window:** no irreversible decisions, no progress check-ins.
4. **Replace advice with load-bearing help:** take one concrete burden off their plate.
5. **Never make a task a test:** no “prove you’re better,” no worth-measuring.

## Tonight Checklist (copy/paste)

**Tonight, I will:**

* [ ] Ask: company or problem-solving?
* [ ] Offer two concrete options (A/B), not ten
* [ ] Remove one burden (food/admin/ride/chores)
* [ ] Avoid meaning talk, planning talk, comparison talk
* [ ] Avoid “progress check-ins”
* [ ] If risk is high: escalate to professionals

## A 2-minute assessment (so you don’t push at the wrong time)

You’re not diagnosing. You’re choosing **how much pressure this moment can tolerate**.

Ask yourself: *When I suggest something small, what happens?*

* **Locked:** proposals get instantly rejected; effort converts to shame/shutdown; neutral topics don’t hold.
* **Fragile:** they can engage briefly, but expectation triggers collapse; small pushes rebound worse.
* **Restartable:** tiny spontaneous actions still occur; they can tolerate a micro-step without spiraling.

**If unsure → treat as Fragile.** Reduce pressure first.

# TOOLBOX A — Scripts that lower pressure (copy/paste)

Most harm happens through language—especially when you’re scared.

### 1) The opener (prevents “help” from becoming pressure)

* “Do you want company right now, or do you want help solving something?”
* “I can do either. I just don’t want to accidentally add pressure.”

If they say “I don’t know,” default to **company**.

### 2) When they shut down (“nothing helps”)

* “Okay. We don’t have to fix anything tonight.”
* “Can I just sit with you for ten minutes?”
* “You don’t have to talk. I’m here.”

### 3) When they feel ashamed

* “I’m not measuring you.”
* “This isn’t a test you’re failing.”
* “I’m not disappointed in you. I’m worried—and I care.”

### 4) When they get angry at you

* “I hear you. I’m going to stop pushing.”
* “I’m on your side. I can step back and just be here.”

### 5) When they ask: “What should I do?”

Don’t answer with a life plan. Answer with a micro-choice:

* “Let’s pick the smallest next step: food, shower, or fresh air?”
* “We don’t need the right answer. Just one gentle move.”

### 6) When you need a boundary (without turning it into punishment)

* “I love you. I’m not leaving.”
* “I can’t do everything, but I can do **these two things**: ____ and ____.”
* “If we’re talking about harming yourself or using again tonight, I’m going to bring in help. That’s care, not control.”

---

# TOOLBOX B — Replace advice with **load-bearing help**

If they’re stuck, they don’t need a lecture. They need **less weight**.

### A menu of burdens you can carry (choose ONE)

Offer it as a concrete action:

* **Food:** “I’ll bring something easy. Salty or sweet?”
* **Scheduling:** “I can find options and book one—do you want that?”
* **Admin:** “I can handle one call, email, or bill tonight.”
* **Space:** “Want me to do dishes, take out trash, or reset one corner?”
* **Transport:** “I can drive you to ____ and we can leave whenever.”
* **Presence:** “I can sit here. No talking required.”

**Rule:** Don’t stack offers. Two options maximum. Too many choices becomes pressure.

---

# TOOLBOX C — The 7-day Pause Window (stability without escalation)

When someone is Locked or Fragile, the goal is not progress. The goal is **no additional damage**.

### What a pause window means

For the next 7 days:

**We do not:**

* make irreversible decisions (quitting jobs, burning relationships, moving out, major financial moves)
* do progress check-ins (“are you better yet?”)
* demand meaning, motivation, or gratitude

**We do:**

* protect basics (sleep, food, hydration, minimal hygiene)
* reduce external pressure
* keep connection open without expectation

### A simple phrase to set it up

“Let’s take one week where we don’t make any big decisions. Just stabilize. We can revisit later.”

### The 3-anchor day (minimum viable routine)

Not a self-improvement plan—just “keep the system online.”

* **Anchor 1:** one reliable intake (any food is fine)
* **Anchor 2:** one light exposure (step outside or open a window for a few minutes)
* **Anchor 3:** one small reset (shower **OR** change clothes **OR** brush teeth)

That’s it. Anything beyond this is bonus.

### What you do as the helper during the pause window

* handle one concrete burden every 1–3 days
* keep contact predictable (“I’ll text at 7pm; no need to reply”)
* reduce chaos: fewer messages, fewer urgent asks, fewer debates

---

# TOOLBOX D — Micro-restart (only when there’s a little spark)

Only do this if they’re **Restartable**. If the micro-step triggers shame or shutdown, return to the pause window.

### The four rules (non-negotiable)

A micro-restart action must be:

1. **Low risk** — failure costs nothing
2. **Not fully controllable** — real-world uncertainty exists
3. **Externally consequential** — touches something outside their head
4. **Sustainably small** — repeatable, not expandable

### Micro-restart menu (choose one lane)

**Lane 1: Care anchor (responsibility without evaluation)**

* feed a pet / refill water bowl
* water a plant on a specific day
* keep one shared space functional (one countertop, not the whole house)

**Lane 2: Maintenance (showing up beats inspiration)**

* reply to one message (not an inbox cleanse)
* do one “keep-life-running” task: refill meds box, pay one bill, schedule one appointment
* help a friend with a tiny, bounded task (10 minutes max)

**Lane 3: Rhythm anchor (time becomes directional again)**

* a 7-minute walk at the same time daily
* step outside for 3 minutes of daylight
* one fixed “reset moment” daily (shower or change clothes)

**Lane 4: External contact (without performance)**

* text one person: “No need to reply. Just thinking of you.”
* sit in a café for 10 minutes (no socializing required)

### The most important warning

If the action becomes a test—“prove you’re better”—it will stop working.

# TOOLBOX E — Addiction moments: friction without coercion

Addiction often moves fast. When someone is at risk of using, the job is not to lecture them into insight—it’s to **slow the moment down** and make harmful action harder while making safer alternatives easier.

This section is supportive containment, not control. If there is imminent overdose risk, or you’re outmatched, escalate to professionals immediately.

> **Boundary note (important):**
> Do not confiscate items, block exits, physically restrain someone, or use force.
> If you feel you need force, you are already outmatched—bring in professional help.

### 1) Delay is a real intervention

Say:

* “Can we wait 20 minutes together before you decide?”
* “I’m not asking you to promise forever. Just 20 minutes.”

Then do something sensory and grounding: water, food, shower, short walk, sit in a different room, change environment.

### 2) Add friction **with consent**

If they agree, you can add practical friction:

* leave the house together
* avoid easy access to cash/keys (again: with consent)
* don’t keep substances/alcohol in the home

Keep the tone collaborative:

* “Let’s make tonight a little harder for the worst decision and easier for the safer one.”

### 3) Replace the “all-or-nothing” narrative

After a slip or relapse, many people spiral because they treat it as total failure.

You can say:

* “This doesn’t erase everything.”
* “Let’s focus on the next safe hour.”
* “The goal tonight is no further damage.”

### 4) Do not weaponize disappointment

**Avoid:**

* “How could you do this to us?”
* “You promised.”

**Use:**

* “I’m glad you told me.”
* “I’m staying with you through the next step.”

# TOOLBOX F — Family coordination (so you don’t become a pressure swarm)

Multiple helpers often create accidental harm: too many texts, too many opinions, too many “check-ins.”

### A simple coordination plan

* pick **one point person** for daily contact (others step back)
* agree on one shared approach: **no progress check-ins**
* keep messages predictable and light
* if you disagree about strategy, do it **away from them**

### A script for relatives who want to push

“I know you want to help. The plan is pressure reduction for one week. No pep talks, no goals. If you want to support, take a practical task.”

---

# TOOLBOX G — Your own nervous system (the hidden variable)

If you’re panicking, you will push. Pushing becomes pressure. Pressure becomes harm.

### Helper self-check (30 seconds)

Ask:

* “Am I trying to help them—or reduce my anxiety?”
* “Am I asking for progress because I can’t tolerate waiting?”

If yes: **do less**, not more.

* send one calm message
* do one practical task
* stop the debate

You don’t need to be perfect. You need to be **non-escalating**.

---

## Closing: the standard you can actually meet

You cannot rescue someone by force. You can’t argue them into the future. You can’t “say the right thing” and fix a locked state.

But you *can* do something powerful:

* **stop adding pressure**
* **keep irreversible doors from closing**
* **create one small, repeatable point of contact with reality**

In many crises, that’s what “help” actually is.

> **Framework note**
> This toolbox uses a structural lens inspired by **FIT (Force–Information–Time) dynamics framework**, a phase-based way to describe how systems can become stable yet hard to change.
> The goal is not diagnosis or moral judgment, but harm reduction: avoid turning care into pressure, preserve remaining options, and support restart only when the structure allows.
