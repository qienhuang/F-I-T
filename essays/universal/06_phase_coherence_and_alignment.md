## Phase, Coherence, and Alignment

### Temporal Relations as the Basis of Systemic Order

---

### 6.1 From Scale to Relation

Scale decomposition reveals *what* temporal structures exist.
Frequency-domain observation reveals *where* energy is distributed.

Neither, by itself, explains **how structures interact**.

That interaction is governed by **temporal relations**—specifically phase and coherence. These relations determine whether multiple structures function as a system or merely coexist.

---

### 6.2 Phase as Relative Temporal Position

In t-Theory, **phase** is defined as:

> **The relative temporal positioning between recurrent structures operating at the same scale.**

Phase does not require periodicity. It requires only:

* Recognizable recurrence
* Comparable temporal scope
* Causal relevance

Phase answers the question:
*When one structure changes, where is another structure in its own cycle?*

---

### 6.3 Phase Alignment and Functional Coupling

Phase alignment exists when:

* Changes in one structure consistently occur at predictable positions in another.
* Feedback arrives within the window where it can influence subsequent cycles.
* Temporal expectations are met repeatedly.

Alignment does not require simultaneity. It requires **predictable relational timing**.

Aligned systems may appear asynchronous on the surface while remaining structurally coherent.

---

### 6.4 Phase Lag as Structural Delay

Phase lag is not error. It is information.

A stable system tolerates bounded phase lag. Such lag encodes:

* Processing time
* Filtering
* Memory

However, when phase lag exceeds the system’s recovery tolerance, causal influence decays. Actions arrive too late to matter, and feedback loses relevance.

At this point, lag becomes **structural**, not incidental.

---

### 6.5 Phase Drift and Loss of Recoverability

Phase drift occurs when relative timing changes accumulate across cycles.

Key properties of phase drift:

* It is gradual, not abrupt.
* It often remains invisible at the event level.
* It becomes irreversible beyond a threshold.

Once drift exceeds the system’s capacity for correction, **realignment without restructuring becomes impossible**.

This is a critical asymmetry: alignment can be lost slowly but rarely regained symmetrically.

---

### 6.6 Coherence as Shared Temporal Constraint

**Coherence** measures whether multiple structures are governed by a common temporal constraint.

High coherence indicates:

* Shared reference tempos
* Common boundary conditions
* Mutual predictability

Low coherence indicates:

* Competing temporal drivers
* Fragmented constraints
* Superficial synchronization without causal linkage

Coherence is not coordination. It is **structural dependence**.

---

### 6.7 Apparent Synchrony Versus Structural Coherence

Systems may appear synchronized while lacking coherence.

This occurs when:

* External forcing aligns surface behavior
* Internal feedback remains decoupled
* Timing is imposed rather than shared

Such systems exhibit fragile order. Removing the forcing reveals immediate disintegration.

t-Theory distinguishes **forced synchrony** from **emergent coherence**.

---

### 6.8 Alignment as a Systemic State

Alignment is not an action. It is a state.

A system is aligned when:

* Key structures exhibit bounded phase relations.
* Coherence persists across relevant scales.
* Feedback closes before phase drift accumulates.

Alignment is therefore **a condition for effective action**, not an outcome of it.

---

### 6.9 Misalignment as a Precursor to Failure

Before visible failure, systems exhibit characteristic misalignment patterns:

* Decisions lag behind conditions.
* Responses address outdated states.
* Corrections amplify instability.

These symptoms are often misattributed to poor execution or intent. In t-Theory, they are recognized as **temporal misalignment**.

---

### 6.10 Alignment Across the FIT Axes

Alignment must occur across FIT dimensions:

* **F–t alignment** ensures force is applied when it can propagate.
* **I–t alignment** ensures distinctions are resolved before relevance expires.
* **F–I alignment** ensures detected differences correspond to directional pressure.

Failure in any alignment dimension destabilizes the whole.

---

### 6.11 Alignment Is Local and Bounded

No complex system is globally aligned.

Alignment exists:

* Within bounded scales
* Over finite durations
* Relative to specific structures

Attempts to enforce global alignment produce rigidity or collapse.

Effective systems maintain **localized alignment with controlled misalignment elsewhere**.

---

### 6.12 Summary

This chapter establishes a critical distinction:

> **Order is not the absence of variation, but the maintenance of phase relations within recoverable bounds.**

Phase, coherence, and alignment define whether temporal structures function as a system or fragment into noise.

The next chapter will formalize **constraint theorems and failure modes**, showing why certain misalignments are not merely problematic but **structurally irreversible** once crossed.
