## Reconstructing FIT as Dynamic Axes

### From Descriptive Dimensions to Structural Coordinates

---

### 2.1 Why FIT Must Be Reconstructed

The FIT framework—Force (F), Information (I), and time (t)—is often interpreted descriptively: as a convenient way to label motivation, capability, and speed. Such interpretations are insufficient for a general theory.

To support a cross-domain, structurally rigorous theory, FIT must be reformulated as a **set of independent dynamic axes**. These axes do not describe outcomes or intentions; they define the **space within which system behavior is possible**.

This chapter establishes FIT not as a metaphor, but as a **coordinate system for system evolution**.

---

### 2.2 Axes, Not Variables

In t-Theory, F, I, and t are not treated as scalar variables to be maximized or balanced. They are treated as **axes of constraint**.

An axis, in this sense:

* Cannot be eliminated without collapsing the space.
* Cannot be substituted by another axis.
* Defines degrees of freedom, not preferences.

System behavior is understood as a trajectory within this three-dimensional constraint space.

---

### 2.3 F — Force as a Driving Field

Force (F) is defined as the **directional pressure that biases system state transitions**.

It is not intention, desire, or will, though it may manifest as such in certain domains. Formally, F represents:

* Gradients in payoff, energy, or viability
* Selection pressures
* Incentive landscapes
* Constraint-induced asymmetries

F does not execute actions. It **shapes the probability distribution of possible actions**.

A system without F is directionless.
A system with excessive F but insufficient structure becomes unstable.

---

### 2.4 I — Information as Distinguishability Capacity

Information (I) is defined as the **capacity of a system to distinguish between states and respond differentially**.

This definition is deliberately broader than data, knowledge, or intelligence. I includes:

* Resolution of internal state representation
* Bandwidth of signal processing
* Accuracy of feedback interpretation
* Capacity to model or anticipate differences

I determines not what a system wants to do, but **what differences it is capable of noticing and acting upon**.

Increasing I expands the system’s state space. It does not guarantee coherence within it.

---

### 2.5 t — Time as Internal Temporal Structure

Time (t), within FIT, is not a clock variable.

It denotes the **internal temporal structure** through which F and I interact.

This includes:

* Delays between cause and effect
* Recurrence intervals of feedback
* Synchronization constraints
* Ordering of dependencies

t determines **when** distinctions detected by I can influence trajectories shaped by F.

Time is therefore not an independent backdrop. It is the **medium of coupling**.

---

### 2.6 Orthogonality of the FIT Axes

A central claim of t-Theory is that F, I, and t are **orthogonal axes**.

This implies:

* Increasing F cannot compensate for insufficient I.
* Increasing I cannot bypass temporal constraints.
* Modifying t without regard to F and I produces structural distortion.

Any theory or intervention that collapses two axes into one is incomplete by construction.

Orthogonality is not empirical convenience; it is a structural necessity.

---

### 2.7 Coupling Limits and Mismatch

System failure frequently arises not from weakness along a single axis, but from **mismatch between axes**.

Examples of structural mismatch include:

* F pushing state transitions faster than t can propagate feedback.
* I detecting distinctions that cannot be acted upon within available temporal windows.
* t enforcing rhythms incompatible with the gradients imposed by F.

Such mismatches do not self-correct. They accumulate until temporal structure breaks.

---

### 2.8 FIT Space as a Feasibility Envelope

Together, the FIT axes define a **feasibility envelope**.

Within this envelope:

* Coherent behavior is possible.
* Feedback remains meaningful.
* System identity persists.

Outside it:

* Actions decouple from consequences.
* Information becomes noise.
* Force manifests as instability rather than progress.

This envelope is not static. It evolves as the system evolves, but it cannot be ignored.

---

### 2.9 Why t Is Not Derivable from F or I

It is tempting to treat time as an emergent consequence of force or information processing. t-Theory rejects this reduction.

Temporal structure constrains both:

* F can only exert influence at temporal access points.
* I can only resolve distinctions within temporal resolution limits.

Therefore, t cannot be derived from F or I. It must be treated as a **first-class structural dimension**.

---

### 2.10 Summary

This chapter redefines FIT as a structural coordinate system:

* **F** defines directional pressure.
* **I** defines distinguishability capacity.
* **t** defines temporal geometry.

System behavior is not the result of any single axis, but of their **joint constraints**.

The next chapter will focus exclusively on the t-axis, formalizing **tempo as structure rather than speed**, and establishing why time deserves independent theoretical treatment.
