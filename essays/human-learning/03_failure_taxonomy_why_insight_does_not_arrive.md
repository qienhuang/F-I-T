## Failure Taxonomy: Why Insight Does Not Arrive

### Structural Reasons Understanding Remains Impossible

---

### 3.1 Why Failure Must Be Classified Structurally

When insight does not arrive, explanations usually target the individual:

* “不够聪明”
* “不够努力”
* “方法不对”
* “天赋不行”

These explanations personalize failure.

t-Theory rejects this framing.

> **Failure to achieve insight is often not a personal limitation,
> but a structural impossibility created by temporal conditions.**

This chapter classifies the **structural failure modes** that prevent insight regardless of motivation or intelligence.

---

### 3.2 Failure Mode I — Persistent High-Frequency Dominance

**Description**

Learning activity remains dominated by short-horizon signals:

* memorizing definitions
* rehearsing procedures
* recognizing familiar patterns

**Structural Signature**

* fast perceived progress
* high confidence without transfer
* collapse under slight variation

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Low-frequency structure never gains dominance.
All cognitive energy circulates within the familiarity regime.

> **The system is stable—but trapped.**

---

### 3.3 Failure Mode II — Temporal Compression (Learning Too Fast)

**Description**

Material is consumed, reviewed, or practiced at excessive speed.

**Structural Signature**

* constant exposure
* minimal gaps
* no opportunity for scale formation

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Scale accumulation requires elapsed time, not event count.

Compression destroys the very delays needed for integration.

> **You cannot think across time that never exists.**

---

### 3.4 Failure Mode III — Contextual Narrowness

**Description**

Repetition occurs within a single context:

* same examples
* same problem types
* same explanatory framing

**Structural Signature**

* performance improves locally
* transfer fails globally

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Invariant structure cannot be distinguished from context-specific cues.

The learner never sees what must remain constant.

---

### 3.5 Failure Mode IV — Phase Drift Across Representations

**Description**

Multiple internal representations fail to align:

* intuition conflicts with formalism
* examples contradict definitions
* prior knowledge interferes

**Structural Signature**

* oscillating understanding
* inconsistent explanations
* recurring confusion

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Without phase alignment, no stable low-frequency structure can emerge.

> **The system cannot lock onto itself.**

---

### 3.6 Failure Mode V — Feedback Horizon Truncation

**Description**

Feedback arrives too quickly or too shallowly:

* immediate correctness checks
* binary right/wrong evaluation
* no delayed consequences

**Structural Signature**

* surface optimization
* brittle understanding
* illusion of mastery

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Feedback that closes too fast reinforces high-frequency cues.

Low-frequency errors remain invisible.

---

### 3.7 Failure Mode VI — Performance Pressure and Coercion

**Description**

Learning is driven by deadlines, evaluation, or fear of failure.

**Structural Signature**

* urgency dominates
* reflection collapses
* speed substitutes for coherence

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Pressure amplifies high-frequency activity and suppresses scale formation.

> **Coercion increases frequency, not depth.**

---

### 3.8 Failure Mode VII — Premature Explanation Lock-In

**Description**

An early explanation becomes fixed before structure stabilizes.

**Structural Signature**

* fluent verbalization
* rigid interpretation
* resistance to contradiction

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Early lock-in prevents destructive interference of wrong structures.

The system protects coherence at the wrong scale.

---

### 3.9 Failure Mode VIII — Absence of Temporal Slack

**Description**

The learner’s environment allows no idle time:

* constant tasks
* continuous input
* no mental quiet

**Structural Signature**

* accumulation without consolidation
* shallow familiarity across many topics

**Why Insight Is Impossible**

Temporal slack is required for filtering and alignment.

> **Insight needs time that appears “unproductive.”**

---

### 3.10 Compound Failure Modes

Failure modes rarely appear alone.

Common combinations include:

* speed + pressure
* familiarity + narrow context
* early explanation + shallow feedback

These compounds create **structurally sealed regimes** where insight cannot occur.

---

### 3.11 Why Effort Often Makes Failure Worse

A paradox explained by t-Theory:

> **More effort can deepen the wrong structure.**

Effort applied within an infeasible temporal regime:

* reinforces high-frequency dominance
* accelerates lock-in
* increases frustration

This explains why “再努力一点” often backfires.

---

### 3.12 Non-Arrival of Insight Is Not a Defect

A crucial reframing:

> **Not understanding is not a flaw in the learner.
> It is often a signal that the temporal structure is invalid.**

Blaming the learner obscures the real constraint.

---

### 3.13 Structural Reset in Human Learning

When insight remains impossible, two outcomes exist:

1. **Reset**

   * abandoning the topic
   * changing representation
   * re-entering with new temporal conditions

2. **Entrenchment**

   * deeper familiarity without understanding
   * long-term aversion

Only reset allows the possibility of future grokking.

---

### 3.14 Summary

This chapter establishes a hard conclusion:

> **Insight does not fail to appear because the learner is insufficient.
> It fails because the temporal structure forbids it.**

Understanding is not earned by effort alone.
It is permitted only when time is allowed to reorganize representation.

---

## Closing of the Human Learning Core

With this chapter, the human-learning branch now establishes:

* insight as temporal phase transition
* repetition as scale accumulation
* non-understanding as structural failure

What remains is not instruction—but humility before time.
