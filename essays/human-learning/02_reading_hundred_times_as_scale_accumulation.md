## “Reading a Hundred Times” as Scale Accumulation

### Why Repetition Sometimes Produces Insight—and Often Never Does

---

### 2.1 Why Repetition Is Widely Misunderstood

The phrase *“读书百遍，其义自见”* is commonly interpreted as a claim about quantity:

* read more
* repeat enough times
* understanding will eventually appear

This interpretation is structurally incorrect.

t-Theory makes a sharper distinction:

> **Repetition is not a cause of insight.
> Repetition is a temporal pressure that may or may not enable structural reorganization.**

In many cases, repetition produces only deeper familiarity—never understanding.

---

### 2.2 Repetition Operates Primarily at High Frequency

Each act of reading or rehearsal is a **high-frequency event**:

* short-horizon exposure
* immediate recognition gains
* localized reinforcement

High-frequency repetition strengthens:

* surface cues
* pattern recall
* speed and confidence

These improvements are real—but they are **confined to the familiarity regime**.

> **High-frequency accumulation cannot, by itself, generate low-frequency structure.**

---

### 2.3 What “Hundred Times” Actually Encodes

t-Theory interprets “hundred times” not numerically, but structurally.

It encodes four implicit temporal requirements:

1. **Extended Duration**
   Enough elapsed time for representations to interact across cycles.

2. **Contextual Variation**
   Exposure across differing internal and external states.

3. **Phase Drift Reduction**
   Gradual alignment between competing internal representations.

4. **Noise Averaging**
   Suppression of high-frequency idiosyncratic cues.

If these conditions are absent, a thousand repetitions will not help.

---

### 2.4 Scale Accumulation Versus Event Accumulation

A critical distinction:

* **Event accumulation**: more instances of the same interaction
* **Scale accumulation**: integration across longer temporal horizons

Most repetition increases event count without increasing scale.

Scale accumulation requires:

* time gaps
* revisitation under altered mental states
* interaction with other knowledge structures

> **Scale accumulates only when representations survive across time, not when they are refreshed rapidly.**

---

### 2.5 Why Spacing Alone Is Not the Explanation

Spacing is often proposed as the key variable.

t-Theory clarifies:

* spacing is neither sufficient nor necessary
* its only value is that it can:

  * disrupt high-frequency dominance
  * permit low-frequency recurrence
  * allow phase relationships to stabilize

Spacing without structural interaction still produces familiarity, not insight.

---

### 2.6 The Role of Internal Phase Alignment

During repetition, multiple internal representations coexist:

* literal wording
* examples
* prior misconceptions
* analogies

Initially, these are **out of phase**:

* activated at different times
* competing for dominance
* context-dependent

Repetition across time can allow:

* destructive interference of incompatible cues
* constructive alignment of invariant structure

> **Insight occurs when invariant components phase-lock across contexts.**

---

### 2.7 The Threshold Phenomenon

As repetition continues, nothing appears to change—until it does.

t-Theory explains this with a dominance threshold:

* low-frequency structure grows invisibly
* high-frequency familiarity masks progress
* performance remains flat

When low-frequency coherence exceeds a critical proportion:

* interpretation collapses into simplicity
* transfer becomes effortless
* explanation compresses dramatically

This is the **insight moment**.

---

### 2.8 Why Some Learners Never Reach the Threshold

Many learners repeat endlessly without insight.

Structural reasons include:

* **Contextual Narrowness**
  Repetition always occurs in the same mode or environment.

* **Tempo Mismatch**
  Repetition occurs too rapidly, preventing scale formation.

* **Feedback Truncation**
  No opportunity to test invariance across contexts.

* **High-Frequency Addiction**
  Preference for fluency and speed reinforces familiarity dominance.

These conditions trap the learner below the threshold indefinitely.

---

### 2.9 Why “Forcing Understanding” Backfires

Attempts to force insight—through pressure, speed, or performance demand—often fail.

Structurally:

* pressure increases high-frequency activity
* speed amplifies surface cue reliance
* evaluation shortens feedback horizons

All three **strengthen the wrong regime**.

> **Insight cannot be coerced because coercion increases frequency, not scale.**

---

### 2.10 Repetition as a Filtering Process

Properly interpreted, repetition functions as a **filter**, not a builder.

Across time, repetition can:

* attenuate fragile cues
* expose contradictions
* reveal invariants

But filters require time to operate.

> **Filtering is slow by definition.
> Acceleration destroys its effect.**

---

### 2.11 The Irreversibility of True Scale Accumulation

Once low-frequency structure stabilizes:

* future repetitions reinforce understanding, not familiarity
* re-reading becomes faster but deeper
* transfer generalizes automatically

This explains the common experience:

> *“After I finally understood it, everything else became easy.”*

The ease is not luck—it is structural compression.

---

### 2.12 Summary

This chapter establishes a strict reinterpretation:

> **“读书百遍，其义自见” describes a process of scale accumulation leading to a temporal phase transition—not linear repetition.**

Repetition enables insight only when it:

* spans sufficient time
* crosses contexts
* permits phase alignment
* suppresses high-frequency dominance

Absent these conditions, repetition produces only fluency.
