## Insight as a Temporal Phase Transition

### From Familiarity to Coherent Generalization

### 1.1 The Two-Regime Model of Human Learning

t-Theory distinguishes two stable regimes:

1. **Familiarity / Memorization Regime (High-Frequency Dominance)**

   * short-horizon recall
   * context-bound performance
   * rapid but fragile improvement
   * “感觉懂了”但一换题就崩

2. **Understanding Regime (Low-Frequency Coherence)**

   * invariance across contexts
   * stable transfer
   * compressed representation
   * “一通百通”式泛化

These are not stages on a smooth continuum.
They are **distinct temporal regimes**.

---

### 1.2 Why Effort Often Stays Trapped in Familiarity

Familiarity forms quickly because it is high-frequency:

* repeated exposure reinforces local cues
* recognition improves
* retrieval becomes faster
* confidence rises

But high-frequency dominance cannot produce low-frequency structure by accumulation alone.

> **Familiarity is a stable attractor.
> Many learners never leave it.**

---

### 1.3 What Must Exist for Insight to Be Possible

Insight requires the emergence of low-frequency structure:

* a representation that persists across varied inputs
* a mapping that compresses superficial variation
* a stable “concept backbone” that survives context shifts

t-Theory states a necessary condition:

> **Low-frequency coherence must become dominant over high-frequency cues.**

Until then, insight is structurally impossible.

### 1.4 Why “顿悟” Appears Sudden

A low-frequency structure can be forming while the learner sees no progress.

Because performance metrics (speed, test score) are **time-domain projections**, they may remain flat.

When low-frequency coherence crosses a dominance threshold:

* contradictions collapse
* transfer becomes effortless
* explanation becomes concise
* confidence becomes justified

The learner experiences a discontinuity:

> **The mind did not suddenly become smarter.
> The temporal structure reorganized.**

### 1.5 “读书百遍，其义自见” as a Temporal Phenomenon

This proverb is often misread as mere repetition.

t-Theory interprets it structurally:

* repetition is not the cause
* repetition is a **pressure** applied over time
* its only value is that it may enable:

  * cross-context exposure
  * phase alignment across internal representations
  * reduction of high-frequency noise
  * stabilization of low-frequency recurrence

Therefore:

> **“百遍”不是数量学；它是时间结构对齐的过程学。**
> It describes a long plateau before phase transition, not linear accumulation.

---

### 1.6 Why Insight Is Often Irreversible

Once low-frequency structure is dominant:

* relearning accelerates
* forgetting slows
* transfer becomes automatic

This resembles grokking’s post-transition robustness.

Regression usually means:

* the transition never fully occurred, or
* the new structure lacked sufficient scale separation

---

### 1.7 Failure Mode Preview: Why Insight Doesn’t Arrive

Insight fails when:

* high-frequency cues remain dominant
* feedback horizons are too short
* phase drift accumulates across contexts
* the environment forces tempo mismatch (too fast / too fragmented)

These are temporal failures, not motivational failures.

This module will classify them formally.

### 1.8 Summary

This chapter establishes the strict definition:

> **Human insight is a temporal phase transition from high-frequency familiarity to low-frequency coherent representation.**

It is delayed by necessity, sudden by structure, and absent when temporal feasibility is violated.
