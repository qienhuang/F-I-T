# t-Theory × Human Learning / Insight

## Chapter 0 — Orientation

### Why “Insight” Must Be Treated as Temporal Structure

---

### 0.1 The Category Error in Most Discussions of Insight

Human insight (“顿悟”, “aha moment”) is commonly treated as:

* a subjective experience
* an intelligence indicator
* a motivational event
* a mysterious cognitive shortcut

These descriptions emphasize phenomenology while ignoring feasibility.

t-Theory reframes the question:

> **When is insight temporally possible, and when is it structurally impossible—regardless of effort?**

This is not a psychological question.
It is a **temporal feasibility** question.

### 0.2 Insight Is Not an Event; It Is a Transition

In t-Theory, an “event” is not explanatory unless it corresponds to a structural change.

Therefore, t-Theory defines insight as:

> **A discrete reorganization of temporal structure in internal representation.**

The subjective “click” is downstream:
a person notices the moment the new structure becomes dominant.

### 0.3 Why This Must Be Unified With Grokking

Grokking in machine learning shows the same signature pattern:

* long plateau of apparent stagnation
* sudden jump to generalization
* robustness after the jump

Human insight exhibits the same temporal shape.

t-Theory’s position is explicit:

> **Human insight and machine grokking are the same phenomenon at different substrates: a phase transition in temporal coherence.**

### 0.4 Scope of This Module

This module:

* does not give learning techniques
* does not propose pedagogy
* does not rely on neuroscience details
* does not assume a particular cognitive architecture

It only assumes minimal conditions:

1. internal representation updates over time
2. feedback influences future updates
3. patterns can persist or collapse across contexts

---

### 0.5 Reading Guidance

This module builds on core t-Theory primitives:

* time as structure (not speed)
* scale decomposition
* phase alignment and coherence
* reset vs grokking

Readers seeking “how to study faster” should stop here.
