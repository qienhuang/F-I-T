## Purpose

This document defines **how Phase II of the F-I-T framework should be cited, described, and bounded** in academic, policy, engineering, and public contexts.

Its primary function is **scope control**:
- to enable precise citation,
- to prevent overclaiming,
- and to avoid transforming a judgment instrument into an authority claim.

---

## What Phase II Is (Citation Scope)

Phase II contributes **three tightly scoped elements**:

1. **Tempo Inequality**  
   A structural principle stating that loss of steering authority occurs when
   effective correction latency exceeds irreversible commitment tempo.

2. **No-Return Memo (NRM)**  
   A standardized, falsifiable instrument for issuing time-gated judgments
   within explicit system boundaries.

3. **Emptiness Window**  
   A bounded intervention pattern that temporarily suppresses irreversible
   commitments to restore temporal slack, without prescribing outcomes.

These elements together constitute **time-gated judgment**, and nothing beyond.

---

## What Phase II Does NOT Claim

Phase II explicitly does **not** claim:

- predictive power over outcomes or collapse,
- normative authority over values or policy,
- inevitability of failure once thresholds are crossed,
- universality across all systems or stages,
- completeness as a governance framework.

Any citation implying the above **misrepresents Phase II**.

## Recommended Citation Language

### Minimal Academic Citation (Preferred)

> Huang, Q. (2026). *Phase II: Time-Gated Judgment in the F-I-T Framework*.  
> Repository: https://github.com/qienhuang/F-I-T/  
> License: CC BY 4.0.

### In-Text Description (Accurate)

> “Phase II of the F-I-T framework introduces a time-gated judgment instrument
> that evaluates whether corrective influence can still arrive before
> irreversible commitments accumulate, without prescribing values or actions.”

---

## Language to Avoid (Overclaiming)

The following phrases **must not** be used to describe Phase II:

- “proves collapse”
- “predicts inevitability”
- “justifies intervention”
- “authorizes shutdown”
- “determines optimal policy”
- “replaces governance”

Such language converts a diagnostic tool into a mandate generator.

---

## Attribution and Authorship

Phase II is authored by **Qien Huang** as part of the F-I-T framework.

It must not be attributed to:
- institutions,
- governments,
- corporate entities,
- or informal collaborators,

unless explicitly stated by the author in writing.

---

## Relation to Other FIT Phases

When citing Phase II, authors should clarify:

- **Phase I** provides structural explanation (Force, Information, Time).
- **Phase II** provides time-gated judgment under acceleration.
- **Phase III** (if referenced) is not defined here and must not be inferred.

Phase II must not be presented as the culmination of FIT.

---

## Use in Policy and Governance Contexts

If Phase II is cited in policy or governance materials, the following must be included:

1. **Non-Authority Clause**  
   Stating that judgments are advisory and non-coercive.

2. **Boundary Disclosure**  
   Explicit description of the system scope analyzed.

3. **Falsification Conditions**  
   What evidence would overturn the judgment.

Absence of these elements invalidates the application.

---

## Use in AI Safety and Engineering Contexts

Acceptable uses include:
- analyzing tempo mismatch in automated systems,
- designing commitment-suppressing safeguards,
- auditing correction latency vs execution speed.

Unacceptable uses include:
- asserting alignment guarantees,
- certifying system safety,
- replacing human accountability.

---

## Citation Integrity Rule

> **Phase II may be cited only for claims it explicitly makes.**

If a conclusion depends on:
- moral judgment,
- political choice,
- or external authority,

it lies **outside Phase II’s scope** and must be cited separately.

---

## Where to Find the Phase II Materials

- Entry point: `docs/core/phase-ii-summary.md`
- No-Return Memo (NRM): `docs/core/no_return_memo.md`
- Tempo Inequality: `overview/tempo-inequality.md`
- Emptiness Window: `essays/ai/emptiness-window.md`
- Non-use boundaries: `docs/core/phase-ii-nonuse.md`
- Release notes: `RELEASE_NOTES_PHASE_II.md`

## Summary Statement

> **Phase II contributes a bounded, falsifiable judgment instrument
> for evaluating temporal viability in late-stage systems.**

Its credibility depends on **restraint in both use and citation**.
