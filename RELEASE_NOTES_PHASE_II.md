## Overview

This release completes **Phase II** of the F-I-T (Force–Information–Time) framework.

Phase II introduces **time-gated judgment**: a bounded capability to assess whether a system remains within a reversible correction window under acceleration and irreversible commitment.

This release does **not** expand FIT’s scope into policy, governance mandates, or prediction.  
It formalizes a **diagnostic layer** applicable to late-stage systems.

---

## What Is New in Phase II

Phase II adds three tightly scoped artifacts:

### 1. Tempo Inequality
A structural principle stating that steering authority is lost when:

```

Effective correction latency > irreversible commitment tempo

```

This reframes late-stage failure as a **temporal phenomenon**, not a cognitive or moral one.

---

### 2. No-Return Memo (NRM)
A standardized, falsifiable instrument for issuing **boundary-limited judgments** on temporal viability.

NRM requires:
- explicit system boundaries,
- enumerated commitment surfaces,
- correction channels with blocking authority,
- falsification conditions.

Its output is advisory and non-authoritative by design.

---

### 3. Emptiness Window
A bounded intervention pattern that **temporarily suppresses irreversible commitments** to restore temporal slack.

It:
- does not prescribe outcomes,
- does not expand authority,
- does not suspend cognition or monitoring.

It operates solely on commitment pathways.

---

## What Phase II Enables

With Phase II, FIT can now:

- distinguish *failure of timing* from *failure of choice*,
- analyze late-stage fragility in accelerated systems,
- issue defensible “too late” judgments without moralization,
- support minimal, reversible interventions that restore steering capacity.

Phase II moves FIT from **explanatory adequacy** to **selection relevance**.

---

## What Phase II Explicitly Does Not Do

Phase II does **not**:

- predict collapse or success,
- authorize intervention or shutdown,
- define values or policy goals,
- replace domain expertise,
- claim inevitability once thresholds are crossed.

Any interpretation suggesting the above is incorrect.

---

## Intended Use

Phase II is intended for:

- AI systems with autonomous execution,
- automated deployment and financial pipelines,
- organizational or institutional systems under acceleration,
- governance analysis where reversibility is in question.

It is **not** intended for:
- early-stage exploratory systems,
- purely normative debate,
- retrospective blame assignment.

---

## Safeguards and Boundaries

This release includes explicit non-use and citation constraints:

- **Non-Authority Clause**  
  Phase II outputs are advisory only.

- **Non-Use Boundaries**  
  Defined cases where Phase II must not be applied.

- **Citation Guidance**  
  Instructions for accurate, non-overreaching reference.

These are integral to Phase II and not optional.

## Position in the FIT Trajectory

- **Phase I**: Structural explanation of evolution (Force, Information, Time)
- **Phase II**: Time-gated judgment under acceleration
- **Phase III**: Not defined in this release

Phase II intentionally stops short of prescribing restart, replacement, or selection mechanisms.

---

## Stability Statement

Phase II is considered **structurally complete and stable**.

Future work may:
- refine metrics,
- add case studies,
- improve formalization,

but will not alter the core principles without explicit version change.

---

## Closing Note

> Phase II does not answer *what should be done*.  
> It answers whether *anything can still arrive in time*.

This release marks the point at which FIT gains the ability to say **“too late”** responsibly—and to refuse to say more.
