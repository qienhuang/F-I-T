# AFDB Non‑LLM Small‑Models Suite — consolidated requirements (v3.1)
#
# This file is a convenience union of subcase requirements for a single-env install.
# You can still install per-subcase requirements independently if preferred.
#
# Subcases:
# - subcases/pae_proxy_alarm/
# - subcases/msa_deficit_proxy/
# - subcases/dual_oracle_active_acquisition/
#
# Notes:
# - Keep versions consistent across the suite if you pin anything.
# - For deterministic builds, consider generating a lockfile via pip-tools or uv.
