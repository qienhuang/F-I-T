# EST Pre-Registration: NYC TLC Trip Records
# Case ID: nyc_tlc_tier2p11
# Version: 1.3
# Date: 2026-01-28
# Primary focus: P11 (regime-change signatures in I/C)
#
# CHANGE LOG from v1.2:
# - Replace C_scarcity with C_price_pressure
#   Rationale: C_scarcity = -log(trip_count) is an activity/demand measure,
#   not a constraint. It was negatively correlated with C_congestion (rho=-0.68)
#   because high demand -> more trips -> more congestion.
#   C_price_pressure = log1p(fare/mile) is a cost measure that should
#   correlate positively with C_congestion (both are "cost of travel").

# Notes for practitioners
notes:
  v1_3_rationale: |
    v1.2 showed C_scarcity = -log(trip_count) is negatively correlated with
    C_congestion (rho=-0.68). This is because trip_count is an activity/demand
    measure: high demand -> more trips -> more congestion.

    v1.3 replaces C_scarcity with C_price_pressure = log1p(fare/mile).
    Both C_congestion and C_price_pressure are "cost of travel" measures:
    - C_congestion: time cost (minutes/mile)
    - C_price_pressure: money cost (dollars/mile)

    Hypothesis: These should correlate positively if they both reflect
    underlying supply-demand constraints.

  q_constraint_validity: |
    This is the EST training point: use estimator family + coherence gate
    to constrain "definition freedom". If coherence fails, the chosen C
    family is inadequate - iterate with different proxies.
