# EST Pre-Registration: NYC TLC Trip Records
# Case ID: nyc_tlc_tier2p11
# Version: 1.4
# Date: 2026-01-28
# Primary focus: P11 (regime-change signatures in I/C)
#
# CHANGE LOG from v1.3:
# - Remove C_concentration from coherence gate
#   Rationale: C_concentration (spatial inequality) measures a different
#   dimension than C_congestion/C_price_pressure (cost of travel).
#   v1.3 showed C_congestion vs C_price_pressure: rho=0.94 [PASS]
#   but C_congestion vs C_concentration: rho=0.32 [FAIL].
#   A 2-estimator family (time cost + money cost) is internally coherent.

# Notes
notes:
  v1_4_rationale: |
    v1.3 discovered that C_congestion and C_price_pressure are highly
    correlated (rho=0.94), both measuring "cost of travel" (time vs money).
    C_concentration (spatial inequality) is orthogonal to this dimension.

    v1.4 uses a focused 2-estimator constraint family:
    - C_congestion: time cost (minutes/mile)
    - C_price_pressure: money cost (dollars/mile)

    This family is internally coherent and allows regime interpretation.
