# EST Pre-Registration: NYC TLC Trip Records
# Case ID: nyc_tlc_tier2p11
# Version: 1.6
# Date: 2026-01-29
# Primary focus: P11 (regime-change signatures in I/C)
#
# CHANGE LOG from v1.5:
# - Generalize coherence windowing beyond calendar years:
#   * date_ranges windowing supports preregistered regime blocks (e.g., pre/post-COVID).
#   * This treats "level shift" as a preregistered boundary (window), not a post-hoc explanation.

# Notes
notes:
  v1_6_rationale: |
    v1.5 established that calendar-year windowing rescues coherence on 2019-2023 Yellow Taxi data:
    pooled coherence can fail due to level shifts while within-window coherence is stable.

    v1.6 generalizes this into preregistered date ranges (regime blocks):
    we treat a known macro boundary (COVID onset) as a window boundary.

    This makes "level shifts" an explicit, auditable boundary rather than a post-hoc narrative.
