# v0.3 Phase A1 — Score Component Diagnosis

This note diagnoses **why `score_sign` appears seed-block dependent** by decomposing the score into its component terms and checking which term drives predictive alignment.

## Setup

- Event: `jump` on `test_acc` (`w_jump=2`, `delta_jump=0.04`, `theta_floor=0.85`, `delta_back=0.03`, `hold_k=5`)
- Blocks:
  - v0.2 eval: seeds `100–119`
  - v0.2.1 eval: seeds `120–139`
- Score (from `grokking.analysis.score.compute_scores`):
  - `score = score_sign * (w_hspec * s_h + w_corr * s_c)`
  - `s_h` is derived from the (smoothed) negative derivative of `H_spec` (layer-wise spectral specialization proxy)
  - `s_c` is derived from `Correction_Rate` relative to `theta_corr`

## Findings (high-level)

### Block 100–119 (v0.2 eval)

- The `H_spec` component dominates the direction of the combined score.
- The observed alignment is consistent with **negative association** between the `H_spec` component and the early-warning label in this block (reported correlation around `-0.173`), which explains why flipping sign (`score_sign=-1`) improves ranking-style metrics (AUC/AP).

### Block 120–139 (v0.2.1 fresh eval)

- Both components appear weak (near-random association), consistent with the held-out result that mean AUC is near `0.50`.

## Implication

The “right” score orientation is not a universal property of the estimator tuple; it is **trajectory-family / seed-block dependent** under the current boundary and logging definitions.

This makes a single fixed-sign score fragile unless we:

- change the estimator tuple (better indicators),
- change the scoring rule (sign-robust / two-sided / ensemble),
- or explicitly restrict the claim to a narrower boundary / trajectory family.
