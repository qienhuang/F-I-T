# FIT-EST Quickstart (5 minutes)

This folder contains a minimal, copy/paste-friendly quickstart demonstrating how to run an EST-style, pre-registered check on a toy system **without external dependencies**.

## What you get

- A single Jupyter notebook: `fit-quickstart.ipynb`
- A minimal "EST audit" that checks basic A1/A6-style fields (scope + pre-registration lock)
- A runnable Tier-1-style demo of:
  - **P10 (coherence)**: agreement between two constraint estimators
  - **P2 (monotonicity)**: constraint non-decrease violation rate under a chosen estimator

## How to run

Open `fit-quickstart.ipynb` in Jupyter/VS Code and run all cells.

No packages are required beyond the Python standard library.
