# FIT Misuse Guard & FAQ

## Preventing common misinterpretations and misapplications

Status: **core-adjacent safeguard**  
Purpose: prevent misuse, overreach, and narrative distortion  
Audience: readers, practitioners, critics, secondary authors

Navigation: [`core index`](./README.md) | [`Core Card`](./fit_core_card.md) | [`Two-Page Card`](./fit_two_page_card.md) | [`Post-Φ₃ bifurcation`](./FIT_Core_Extension_Post_Phi3.md)

Notation: phases are written as `Φ₁/Φ₂/Φ₃` (ASCII: `Phi1/Phi2/Phi3` in filenames/code).

## Why this document exists

FIT is intentionally abstract and cross-domain. This makes it powerful, but also vulnerable to misuse.

This document exists to:
- prevent overextension,
- clarify what FIT does *not* claim,
- preserve the framework's long-term integrity.

Important: this is a guardrail, not a debate script. It is meant to prevent category errors, not to "win arguments".

---

## FAQ 1 - "Is FIT a predictive theory?"

No.

FIT does not predict:
- specific events,
- timelines,
- winners or losers,
- policy outcomes.

FIT constrains structural possibility space, not future facts.

If a claim begins with:
> "FIT predicts that X will happen."

it is almost certainly a misuse.

---

## FAQ 2 - "Does FIT say systems should evolve in a certain direction?"

No.

FIT makes no normative claims. It does not define progress, goodness, or desirability.

Φ₃ (coordination) is not "better" than Φ₁ or Φ₂.  
Path B (hierarchical transition) is not morally superior to Path A.

FIT only describes what is structurally possible under declared scope/estimators.

---

## FAQ 3 - "Can FIT be used to justify political or ideological positions?"

No.

FIT is agnostic to ideology. Using FIT to argue that a particular political system, ideology, or historical path is "inevitable" is a category error.

Such uses violate FIT's explicit red lines.

---

## FAQ 4 - "If evidence contradicts FIT, can it always be dismissed as estimator error?"

No.

Estimator Selection Theory (EST) is a discipline, not a shield.

Legitimate counterexamples:
- respect declared estimators,
- operate within a defined phase context,
- and still contradict a claim.

FIT has already been refined by such pressure (e.g., phase-conditional constraints).

Invoking "estimator issues" to avoid revision is misuse.

---

## FAQ 5 - "Is everything a Phase I / II / III story?"

No.

Not all systems:
- have persistent Information,
- have propagating Force,
- have compressible state spaces.

In such systems, FIT does not apply. Forcing phase language onto inapplicable systems is misuse.

---

## FAQ 6 - "Is Φ₃ always the goal?"

No.

Φ₃ is a stability regime, not an objective. Many systems benefit from remaining in Φ₁ or Φ₂.

Treating Φ₃ as a universal endpoint is a misunderstanding.

---

## FAQ 7 - "Does FIT imply that decline is inevitable after stability?"

No, but it does constrain the options.

After Φ₃, only two structural paths are viable:
- coordination collapse,
- hierarchical transition.

Which path occurs depends on structural conditions, not destiny or moral judgment.

---

## FAQ 8 - "Can FIT be simplified into a slogan or diagram?"

With caution.

Core Cards and Two-Page Cards are acceptable summaries. Reducing FIT to motivational slogans ("embrace chaos", "avoid stability traps") loses essential constraints and is discouraged.

---

## FAQ 9 - "Is FIT compatible with other theories (e.g., FEP, economics, learning theory)?"

Yes, at the structural level.

FIT does not replace domain theories. It provides a higher-level lens for organizing dynamics.

Claims of replacement or supremacy are misuse.

---

## FAQ 10 - "Who decides what counts as correct FIT usage?"

No single authority.

Correct usage is determined by:
- consistency with the Core Card,
- respect for scope and limits,
- willingness to revise under counterexample.

This document provides guidance, not enforcement.

---

## Summary: one-paragraph guardrail

> FIT is a structural analysis framework, not a predictive engine, not a value system, and not a narrative of inevitability. It should be used to reason about constraints and possibilities, not to justify conclusions chosen in advance.

---

## Maintenance note

This document may be updated to address new patterns of misuse, but the FIT core should not be altered to accommodate misinterpretation.

Misuse should be corrected by clarification, not expansion.
