## Purpose

Phase II of the F-I-T framework introduces instruments capable of issuing **No-Return judgments** based on temporal and structural constraints.

This document defines **explicit non-use boundaries**:
cases where applying Phase II tools is **invalid, misleading, or dangerous**.

Its purpose is **containment**, not expansion.

---

## Core Principle

> **A tool that can say “too late” must be more constrained than one that proposes action.**

Phase II judgments carry asymmetric risk:
- False positives can justify premature abandonment or coercion.
- False authority can convert structural analysis into moral mandate.

This document prevents such outcomes.

---

## Absolute Non-Use Cases

Phase II tools **must not be applied** in the following contexts.

---

### 1. Normative or Moral Arbitration

Phase II must not be used to decide:
- what is ethically right,
- who is morally at fault,
- which values should prevail.

**Reason**:  
Tempo inequality evaluates **arrival times**, not legitimacy.

Using it to arbitrate values converts a temporal instrument into a moral weapon.

---

### 2. Justification of Coercive Action

Phase II outputs must not be used to justify:
- forced intervention,
- emergency powers,
- suspension of rights,
- unilateral shutdowns of human systems.

**Reason**:  
NRM judgments are advisory and non-authoritative by design.

Escalating them into coercion violates the Non-Authority Clause.

---

### 3. Retrospective Blame Assignment

Phase II must not be applied **after collapse** to:
- assign guilt,
- validate political narratives,
- legitimize punishment.

**Reason**:  
The framework is forward-looking and time-sensitive.

Post-hoc application is structurally meaningless and politically corrosive.

---

### 4. Early-Stage or Low-Irreversibility Systems

Phase II must not be applied when:
- commitments are easily reversible,
- execution tempo is low,
- correction channels dominate naturally.

**Reason**:  
The tempo inequality does not bind in such regimes.

Applying it prematurely produces false No-Return signals.

---

### 5. Boundary-Ambiguous Systems

Phase II must not be applied when:
- system boundaries are contested,
- responsibility is diffuse,
- commitment surfaces cannot be enumerated.

**Reason**:  
NRM judgments require explicit Ω and K definitions.

Boundary ambiguity invalidates the gate condition.

---

## High-Risk Misuse Patterns

The following are **misuse patterns**, not merely mistakes.

---

### M1. “Too Late Therefore Anything Goes”

Interpreting a No-Return judgment as:
> “Since correction is impossible, any action is justified.”

**Why this is invalid**:  
Phase II diagnoses loss of steering, not permission for domination.

---

### M2. Temporal Determinism

Claiming:
> “The outcome was inevitable once the inequality was crossed.”

**Why this is invalid**:  
Phase II does not predict outcomes.
It diagnoses **loss of control**, not fate.

---

### M3. Weaponized Pessimism

Using Phase II to:
- shut down debate,
- silence dissent,
- enforce resignation.

**Why this is invalid**:  
The framework explicitly forbids value enforcement.

---

### M4. Goodharted Triggers

Designing activation criteria so that:
- systems avoid entering Emptiness Windows,
- metrics are optimized against detection.

**Why this is invalid**:  
It converts safety instrumentation into theater.

---

## Required Safeguards for Legitimate Use

Any legitimate Phase II application must include:

1. **Explicit Non-Authority Clause**  
   Reaffirming advisory-only status.

2. **Falsification Conditions**  
   Clear evidence thresholds that would overturn the judgment.

3. **Boundary Disclosure**  
   What the analysis does *not* cover.

4. **Confidence Qualification**  
   Low / Medium / High, with justification.

Absence of any safeguard invalidates the application.

---

## Relation to Emptiness Window

The Emptiness Window is particularly prone to misuse.

It must **not** be:
- indefinite,
- goal-imposing,
- value-enforcing,
- authority-expanding.

Any use beyond **temporary Ω suppression** violates Phase II constraints.

---

## Enforcement Philosophy

This document intentionally avoids enforcement mechanisms.

Its function is **epistemic hygiene**, not compliance.

Violations of these boundaries do not invalidate the framework,
but they do invalidate the specific application.

---

## Position in Phase II

This document acts as:

- a guardrail against overreach,
- a disclaimer against misuse,
- a signal of intellectual restraint.

It is not optional.

---

## Summary Statement

> **Phase II is a judgment instrument, not a mandate generator.**

Its power lies in restraint.  
Its credibility depends on refusing uses it could easily justify but must not.
