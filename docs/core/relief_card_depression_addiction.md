# Relief Card — Depression & Addiction (FIT)

Artifact type: Core-adjacent Relief Card  
Framework: F-I-T (Force–Information–Time)  
Status: Non-normative / Structural support tool  
Scope: Human depression, burnout, addiction recovery (non-clinical)

---

## Purpose
Provide a structural decision aid for helpers to reduce harm, preserve reversibility, and—when possible—restart evolution.

---

## Core Premise (FIT)
Typical late-stage states show:
- High Constraint (C)
- Low effective Force (F)
- Low Information renewal (I)
- Time (T) loses directional selection

Relief means restoring minimal evolvability, not forcing happiness.

---

## State Classification

### LOCKED
- All proposals negated
- Effort converts to shame/exhaustion
- No sustained neutral response

Action: safety, pressure reduction, presence only.

### FRAGILE
- Intermittent engagement then collapse
- Extreme sensitivity to expectation

Action: Emptiness Window only.

### RESTARTABLE
- Small spontaneous actions persist
- Can tolerate “no meaning yet”
- Accepts low-risk responsibility

Action: micro-restart.

---

## Prohibitions
- Meaning injection
- Immediate optimization
- Comparative framing
- Over-optioning

---

## Emptiness Window
Bounded pause:
- No future commitments
- No evaluation
- No irreversible actions

---

## Micro-Restart Conditions
Task must be:
1. Low risk
2. Not fully controllable
3. Externally consequential
4. Sustainably small

---

## Monitoring Signals
Positive:
- Spontaneous initiation
- Reduced stagnation
- “Maybe later” language

Negative:
- Increased self-blame
- Withdrawal
- Task as worth-proof

---

## Safety Escalation
Any self-harm risk → professional escalation.

---

## Decision Rule
If you cannot reduce Constraint without adding expectation, do not act.
