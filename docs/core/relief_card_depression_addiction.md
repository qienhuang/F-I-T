# Relief Card — Depression & Addiction (FIT)

**Artifact type**: Core-adjacent Relief Card  
**Framework**: F‑I‑T (Force–Information–Time)  
**Status**: Non‑normative / non‑clinical / harm‑reduction oriented  
**Scope**: Depression, burnout, addiction recovery (human context)  
**Red lines**: Not therapy, not diagnosis, not moral evaluation, not coercion

---

## Purpose

Give helpers (family, friends, frontline support workers) a **structural decision aid** to:

- reduce accidental harm from “helping” that increases pressure,
- preserve **reversibility** (keep doors from closing),
- and *when structurally possible*, support a minimal restart of evolution.

This card is designed to be **low‑authority**: it favors restraint over action.

---

## FIT premise (human mapping)

Many severe human crises present as a late‑stage lock pattern:

- **High Constraint (C)**: options feel collapsed; the person experiences “no moves.”
- **Low effective Force (F)**: drives do not propagate across time; action initiation collapses.
- **Low Information renewal (I)**: new experiences don’t rewrite the future; learning feels pointless.
- **Time (T)** loses directional meaning: days pass, but nothing accumulates.

> **Relief (FIT)** is not “be happier.”  
> Relief is **restore minimal evolvability**: a small channel where future can differ from present without shame or coercion.

---

## Step 0 — Safety gate (always first)

If there is any **imminent self‑harm risk**, overdose risk, or inability to maintain basic safety:

- escalate to local emergency / crisis services,
- notify trusted family / professionals,
- do not attempt solo “structural intervention.”

> FIT analysis does not override safety authority.

## Step 1 — Classify state (act only after classification)

### A) `LOCKED` — temporarily non‑restartable

**Indicators (any 2+)**
- Any proposal is immediately negated (“no point / impossible / useless”)
- Attempts at effort convert into shame, exhaustion, or shutdown
- Neutral stimuli produce little sustained reaction

**Correct action**
- ✅ Reduce pressure; maintain presence; protect basic needs
- ❌ Do not push goals, meaning, or plans

**Common failure**
- “If we just motivate them harder” → usually increases C and deepens lock‑in.

---

### B) `FRAGILE` — stabilizable, not accelerable

**Indicators**
- Intermittent engagement followed by sharper collapse
- High sensitivity to expectation (“If I fail this, I’m hopeless”)
- Brief improvements that rebound worse after pressure

**Correct action**
- ✅ Establish an **Emptiness Window** (Step 2)
- ❌ No timelines; no “progress checks”; no escalating challenges

---

### C) `RESTARTABLE` — minimal restart possible

**Indicators**
- Small spontaneous actions still occur (even rare)
- Can tolerate “I don’t know why, but I can try a little”
- Accepts low‑risk responsibility without immediate shame spiral

**Correct action**
- ✅ Micro‑restart (Step 3)
- ❌ Do not scale quickly; do not attach identity or worth to success

---

## Step 2 — Emptiness Window (pressure suspension)

**Goal**: stop further collapse **without** demanding direction.

### Definition (human)
A bounded interval where:
- no future meaning is demanded,
- no optimization is required,
- no irreversible decisions are made,
- basic support continues (sleep/food/hygiene/contact).

### Minimum boundaries
- Protect sleep and nutrition as “system uptime,” not moral virtue
- Avoid life‑altering decisions (quit job, break relationships, major moves) while locked/fragile
- No evaluative talk: “Are you better yet?” is forbidden

**Effect (FIT)**
- halts constraint hardening,
- restores time neutrality,
- preserves the possibility of restart.

---

## Step 3 — Micro‑restart (only if `RESTARTABLE`)

> **Rule**: Restart is not inspiration. Restart is **task design**.

### The restart task must satisfy ALL four conditions

1) **Low risk**  
Failure has no lasting cost; no “proof of worth.”

2) **Not fully controllable**  
Some uncertainty must remain; otherwise no real Force emerges.

3) **Externally consequential**  
Someone/something outside the person is affected (writes Information into the world).

4) **Sustainably small**  
Repeatable without escalation; ideally daily/weekly and time‑bounded.

### Structurally valid task patterns (examples)

- **Care anchor** (responsibility supplies Force)  
  Caring for a dependent object/system: a plant, a pet, a shared household routine.

- **Public maintenance** (external consequence writes Information)  
  Quietly maintaining a system others rely on: documentation, cleanup, a volunteer role.

- **Rhythm anchor** (restore Time directionality)  
  Fixed rhythm action: short walk + daylight at a consistent time; not “fitness,” just a clock.

### Anti‑pattern (do not do)
- “Big goal resets,” “life plans,” “finding meaning,” “build a new you.”  
These are **high‑C** moves that typically break the restart.

---

## Step 4 — Monitoring signals (no scales required)

### Positive signals (restart is working)
- Spontaneous initiation increases (even slightly)
- Stagnation reduces (not necessarily “happier”)
- Language softens from “never” to “maybe later”

### Negative signals (you are adding Constraint)
- Increased self‑blame after tasks
- Withdrawal from you (you became pressure)
- Task is treated as identity proof

**Response**: immediately de‑escalate to Step 2.

---

## Prohibitions (common “help” that harms)

1) **Meaning injection**  
“You need purpose / gratitude / positivity.”

2) **Immediate optimization**  
“From tomorrow, exercise / plan / fix everything.”

3) **Comparative framing**  
“Others have it worse / you’re lucky.”

4) **Over‑optioning**  
Dumping resources, methods, or 10 action steps at once.

> If your FIT language increases shame or pressure, you are misusing it.

---

## FIT alignment (traceability)

- The lock pattern is a human expression of **Constraint accumulation** and reduced evolvability.
- “Emptiness” corresponds to a protective **pause capability** (Phase II alignment), not moral failure.
- Restart corresponds to a **hierarchical restart**: keep base stability while opening a higher‑level exploration channel.

This card adds no new primitives; it is an operational handoff for human contexts.

## One-line decision rule

> **If you cannot reduce Constraint without adding expectation, do not act.**  
> **If you can introduce Force without demanding meaning, proceed carefully.**
