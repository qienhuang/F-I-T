# Case 02 — Content Platforms and Involution

## Scope & Claims Notice

This case illustrates how the FIT framework can be *applied* under a specific
interpretive lens and estimator choice.

It does NOT constitute proof, prediction, or universal validation.
The analysis is structural, not normative.

## System Snapshot
Content platforms evolve from growth to saturation,
often entering price/attention competition loops.

## FIT Variable Mapping
- F: Algorithmic distribution, monetization incentives
- I: Content templates, creator playbooks
- T: Rapid feedback cycles
- C: User attention, creator income limits

## Phase Map
Φ₁:
- Explosive growth, experimentation

Φ₂:
- Successful formats dominate
- Local optimization everywhere

Φ₃:
- Full coordination around metrics
- Marginal gains vanish (involution)

## Post-Φ₃ Bifurcation
Path A:
- Endless optimization, declining value

Path B:
- Force uplift: trust, quality, long-term relationships
- Information uplift: durable creator-audience bonds

## Takeaways
- Involution is a phase condition, not moral failure
- Regulation and platform design reshape constraints
