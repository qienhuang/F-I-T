# Case 04 — Learning: From Memorization to Understanding

## Scope & Claims Notice

This case illustrates how the FIT framework can be *applied* under a specific
interpretive lens and estimator choice.

It does NOT constitute proof, prediction, or universal validation.
The analysis is structural, not normative.


## System Snapshot
Learners often experience sudden shifts from memorization
to genuine understanding.

## FIT Variable Mapping
- F: Practice, feedback
- I: Mental representations
- T: Learning time
- C: Cognitive capacity

## Phase Map
Φ₁:
- Rote memorization

Φ₂:
- Pattern recognition

Φ₃:
- Conceptual understanding

## PT-MSS
- Old shortcuts saturate
- New abstract structures emerge

## Post-Φ₃ Bifurcation
Path A:
- Overfitting to test formats

Path B:
- Meta-learning, transferable understanding

## Takeaways
- Understanding is a phase transition
- Insight emerges when shortcuts fail
