# Case 03 — Enterprise IT: From Tools to Platforms

## Scope & Claims Notice

This case illustrates how the FIT framework can be *applied* under a specific
interpretive lens and estimator choice.

It does NOT constitute proof, prediction, or universal validation.
The analysis is structural, not normative.


## System Snapshot
Organizations often evolve from spreadsheets to tools
and eventually to integrated platforms.

## FIT Variable Mapping
- F: Operational demand, management pressure
- I: Process knowledge, schemas
- T: Quarterly cycles
- C: Coordination cost, error rates

## Phase Map
Φ₁:
- Manual tools, flexibility

Φ₂:
- Specialized software silos

Φ₃:
- Integrated platforms, stable workflows

## Post-Φ₃ Bifurcation
Path A:
- Rigid systems, innovation slowdown

Path B:
- Information uplift: meta-systems, automation rules
- Constraint enveloping: legacy systems as submodules

## Takeaways
- Platform stability is a transition point, not an endpoint
- Successful IT evolution preserves old constraints as layers
