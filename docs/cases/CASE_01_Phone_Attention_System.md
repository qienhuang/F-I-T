# Case 01 — Smartphones and the Attention System

## Scope & Claims Notice

This case illustrates how the FIT framework can be *applied* under a specific
interpretive lens and estimator choice.

It does NOT constitute proof, prediction, or universal validation.
The analysis is structural, not normative.

## System Snapshot
Modern smartphones form a closed-loop attention system combining devices,
apps, notifications, and behavioral feedback.
The system optimizes for engagement, not long-term human goals.

## FIT Variable Mapping
- F: Notifications, social feedback, novelty signals
- I: Habits, learned attention patterns, app usage routines
- T: Sub-second feedback loops, daily repetition
- C: Cognitive bandwidth, sleep, emotional regulation

## Phase Map
Φ₁ Accumulation:
- Rapid habit formation
- High novelty, low structure awareness

Φ₂ Crystallization:
- Stable compulsive usage patterns
- Predictable daily loops

Φ₃ Coordination:
- Behavior stabilized, hard to change
- System absorbs user intent rather than serving it

## PT-MSS Check
- Force redistribution: notifications dominate intent ✔
- Information re-encoding: habits override conscious goals ✔
- Constraint reorganization: attention fully occupied ✔

## Post-Φ₃ Bifurcation
Path A (Collapse):
- Burnout, reduced attention span, loss of agency

Path B (Hierarchical Transition):
- New Force: intentional constraints (design limits, OS-level control)
- New Information: reflective habits, delayed feedback
- Old constraints embedded, not removed

## Takeaways
- Stability ≠ wellbeing
- Escaping Φ₃ requires structural intervention, not willpower
- Attention systems are governance problems, not personal failures
