# FIT Application Cases

These cases illustrate how the FIT framework can be *applied* to familiar social,
organizational, and individual systems.

They are **not proofs** of FIT.
They are **usage examples** designed to help non-specialist readers learn
correct phase-based reasoning.

All cases are interpreted under explicit scope limits and estimator choices.

[Two-Page Card](../core/fit_two_page_card.md) defines FIT's operational grammar; the following cases are curated corpora for learning correct usage.
