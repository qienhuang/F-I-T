# Explorers (specs + loop templates)

This folder contains **exploration specifications**: how to search a method/config space under explicit budgets and hard gates.

Explorers are **not** runnable engines by themselves. If you want runnable implementations, start from:

- `tools/README.md`

## Index

- **FIT-Explorer v0.1** (budgeted, auditable method search): `docs/explorers/fit_explorer/README.md`
