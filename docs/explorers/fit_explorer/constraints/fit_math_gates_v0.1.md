**Date**: 2026-01-27

This file defines the minimal gate set for mathematical discovery exploration.

---

## Gate 1 — Checkability
- Formalizable under declared system
- Proof-checker accepts the artifact

## Gate 2 — Budget
- Must complete within preregistered limits
- Budget overrun → `BUDGET_INCONCLUSIVE`

## Gate 3 — Robustness
- Stable across preregistered representation sweeps
- Flip-rate bound required

## Gate 4 — Governance (optional)
If using an agent to manipulate files/tools:
- skill/lemma admission gate required
- ingestion boundary required
- monitorability collapse triggers ABSTAIN
