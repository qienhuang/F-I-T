# Web Ingestion Boundary (FIT-Explorer v0.1)

**Purpose**: Prevent external content from silently becoming memory/skills/training data.

Four pipelines:
1) read-only retrieval (default)
2) semantic memory write (gated, hashed, cited)
3) skill creation (tests + provenance)
4) training ingestion (offline only, trace-derived only)

(For full details see the slow-evolving agent v0.2 appendices.)
