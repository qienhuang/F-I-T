# Mapping: Mathematical Progress ↔ FIT/EST ↔ FIT-Explorer (v0.1)
**Date**: 2026-01-27

This table makes the “FIT applies to mathematical discovery” claim concrete.

---

| Mathematical concept / process | FIT/EST term | FIT-Explorer artifact | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Axioms / theory / type discipline | Boundary / Scope | prereg scope block | Boundary changes require new prereg |
| Definitions / invariants / effective variables $g$ | Representation / Coarse-graining | search_space: representation families | "New variables" are method primitives |
| Lemmas / tactics / techniques | Skills | versioned lemma/tactic library | Treat as authority expansion in agent settings |
| Proof checker kernel | Hard gate / Validator | checkability gate | Non-LLM, deterministic |
| Proof search budget | Budget constraint | budget policy (SH/Hyperband) | “True but not found” = INCONCLUSIVE |
| Robustness under isomorphism / reparameterization | Coherence / Robustness | robustness gate + sweeps | Avoid representation overfitting |
| Independence / requires stronger axioms | Scope-limited / boundary dependence | failure map: SCOPE_LIMITED | “Needs new boundary” is a valid result |
| Historical “dead ends” | Failure regions | failure map (phase diagram) | Captures negative results systematically |
| New framework (category theory, etc.) | Boundary expansion | new candidate class | Changes admissible moves & gates |

## Interpretation

Mathematics is an exploration in a constrained method space.  
FIT does not replace proof; it replaces **unlogged intuition** with **auditable exploration**.
