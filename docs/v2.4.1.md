# FIT v2.4.1 — Theory Update (Non-breaking): Phase-Conditional Constraints + Learning Dynamics

Status: theory refinement for the v2.4 (EST) line. This is a “patch” update: it does not add new primitives or new propositions; it tightens scope and interpretation under EST.

## Core artifacts (v2.4.1+)

In addition to the scope refinements below, v2.4.1 introduces **core artifacts**: compressed, handoff-ready entry points that do not change the underlying primitives/propositions, but reduce misreadings and make phase-conditional reasoning operational.

See:
- `docs/core/README.md` (index)
- `docs/core/fit_core_card.md` (fast entry)
- `docs/core/MCC.md` (minimal coherent core)
- `docs/core/phase_algebra.md` (phase algebra + PT-MSS)

## What changed (high-level)

Empirical work across:
- Tier-1 cellular automata (e.g., Conway)
- Tier-1.5 / Tier-2 learning dynamics (grokking-style transitions)

shows a recurring pattern: **constraint proxies can temporarily reorganize (or locally regress) during phase transitions**, without violating long-run irreversibility in late coordinated phases.

v2.4.1 formalizes this by making “phase context” first-class in how P2/P17 are interpreted and tested.

## P2 update: Constraint Monotonicity → Phase-Conditional Monotonicity

### Previous interpretation (v2.4)
Constraint proxy `C(t)` is expected to be monotone non-decreasing in late-stage evolution.

### Refined interpretation (v2.4.1)

- **P2a — Phase-Conditional Monotonicity**
  - Within a fixed phase (under an explicit EST estimator specification), constraint proxies exhibit statistically non-decreasing behavior.
- **P2b — Late-Phase Irreversibility**
  - Once a system enters a coordinated structural phase (Φ₃-style), large-scale structural regressions become rapidly unlikely; “irreversibility” is probabilistic rather than “no change”.

Implications:
- Apparent violations at transitions are not counterexamples by default.
- Any P2 claim must declare its phase context and estimator scope.

## P17 clarification: Dimensional Collapse is structural (often cyclic), not linear

Dimensional collapse should be treated as **structural reorganization**:
- Collapse → reconfiguration → re-collapse can occur around transitions.
- Single-point dimensional measurements are insufficient.
- Valid assessment is windowed (EST) and phase-aware.

## Integration with learning dynamics (why grokking belongs here)

Controlled learning systems provide a clean, highly instrumented instantiation of:
- Force propagation (effective gradient signals)
- Information crystallization (emergent features)
- Phase-structured constraint accumulation

They are treated as **EST-compliant validation domains** (not as “real-world validation”).

## Compatibility statement

This update is non-breaking:
- v2.4 evidence remains valid under refined interpretation, but must be described with explicit estimator + phase context.
