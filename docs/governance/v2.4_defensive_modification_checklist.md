# FIT v2.4 Defensive Modification Checklist

This checklist prevents v2.4 from drifting into "framework sprawl". It is intentionally conservative.

Use it whenever you want to change v2.4 (spec, definitions, propositions, or validation claims).

---

## 0) Decision: Is This a Bug Fix or a New Concept?

- Bug fix: clarifies wording, fixes math notation, corrects a broken link, fixes an internal inconsistency, updates a wrong path, or corrects a demonstrable error.
- New concept: adds a new primitive, new axiom, new proposition, new equivalence class, or a new layer of theory.

Rule: allow bug fixes; freeze new concepts unless a clear external need exists.

---

## 1) The "A/B/C" Novelty Filter (Required for Tier-2 Claims)

If a change touches Tier-2 or real-system claims, answer:

- (A) What does the existing field already say about this?
- (B) What is the FIT translation (F/I/T/C + declared estimators)?
- (C) What does FIT predict beyond (A), in a way that can be tested?

If you cannot answer (C), the change is a "demo framing" only, not a core claim.

---

## 2) Estimator Discipline (Non-Negotiable)

For any empirical claim:

 - declare the estimator tuple $E = (S_t, B, (\hat{F}, \hat{C}, \hat{I}), W)$
- declare the task type (ordinal / metric / topological)
- declare the coherence gate used (if any) and the threshold(s)
- declare what would count as failure (scope violation vs proposition failure)

If a claim is not bound to an estimator tuple, it does not belong in the "validated" part of the spec.

---

## 3) Scope Discipline (Avoid Overclaiming)

Every claim must state:

- system boundary and closure assumptions
- what is held constant (coarse-graining, window size, regime)
- what is explicitly not claimed

Use `SCOPE_LIMITED` when evidence is mixed but interpretable under a narrower scope.

---

## 4) Evidence Rules

- Keep negative results as first-class records.
- Do not "fix" failures by changing estimators post-hoc without pre-registration.
- If you change thresholds, record old and new thresholds and why.

---

## 5) Compatibility With v2.4 Design Goals

Before merging:

- Does this change improve falsifiability or auditability?
- Does it lower the barrier for outsiders to reproduce a result?
- Does it reduce ambiguity rather than add it?

If not, it likely belongs in a separate note, not the core spec.
