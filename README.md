# The F‑I‑t (Force–Information–Time) Framework

## A Constraint‑Driven Lens on Evolution Across Physical, Biological, Cognitive, Social, and AI Systems

**Version:** v1.1 (academicized draft)

**Framework established:** Dec 10, 2025 (original)

**This draft:** operational definitions, layer criteria, falsifiable propositions, and boundary conditions

### Abstract

The F‑I‑t (Force–Information–Time) framework is a cross‑domain lens for understanding how systems undergo structural change (“evolution”) when existing organizations can no longer satisfy the constraints imposed by their environments and internal interactions. FIT does not assume intention or teleology. Instead, it models evolution as a **constraint‑driven** process: (i) **forces** generate pressures by imposing constraints, (ii) **information structures** form to absorb and regulate those constraints, and (iii) **time** determines whether such structures persist long enough to influence subsequent dynamics. FIT is presented as a **diagnostic framework** rather than a complete predictive theory. We provide operational definitions for core terms, minimal criteria for a set of conceptual “layers” (L0–L8), and a set of falsifiable propositions and measurement proxies suitable for empirical evaluation in complex systems and AI.

## 1. Core Thesis: Evolution Is Constraint‑Driven, Not Preference‑Driven

Many narratives of progress implicitly assume intention: systems evolve because they “choose” to improve. FIT adopts a simpler stance:

> Structural change occurs when existing organizations cannot satisfy the constraints induced by forces over the relevant time horizon.

This statement is **not** deterministic about *what* will emerge. It only claims that when constraint satisfaction fails persistently, **change becomes likely**, and the space of viable future structures becomes constrained.

### 1.1 Pressure as Residual Constraint

In FIT, “pressure” is not a single physical quantity. It is the residual—experienced internally or observed externally—when a system’s current structure fails to reconcile competing constraints. This is compatible with multi‑agent, multi‑scale, and non‑physical contexts.

### 1.2 The FIT Loop (Process Form)

Across domains, we often observe a recurring loop:

$$
\mathrm{Constraint\ pressure} \;\rightarrow\; \mathrm{structural\ adaptation} \;\rightarrow\; \mathrm{new\ constraint\ landscape}
$$

We write this as:

* **Force (F):** constraint‑inducing influences (external, internal, or interaction‑driven)
* **Information (I):** organizational structure enabling constraint absorption/regulation
* **Time (t):** persistence horizon determining whether structure matters for downstream dynamics

This yields the qualitative FIT loop:

$$
(F, \mathrm{constraints}) \rightarrow I \rightarrow \mathrm{persistence\ over}\ t \rightarrow \mathrm{modified}\ F
$$

## 2. Operational Definitions

FIT becomes useful only if its primitives are operational.

### 2.1 Force (F): Constraint‑Inducing Influence, Not a Single Concept

We define “force” as any influence that changes the feasible set of a system’s states/actions or their relative viability. To avoid conceptual overreach, we explicitly distinguish force types:

* **Physical forces:** field interactions, energy gradients, boundary conditions
* **Selection forces:** differential replication/survival constraints
* **Incentive forces:** reward/penalty signals shaping learning updates
* **Coordination forces:** strategic interactions among agents (conflict, cooperation, uncertainty)
* **Informational forces:** bandwidth limits, overload, latency, noise, adversarial inputs
* **Institutional forces:** rule enforcement, legitimacy constraints, transaction costs

**Attraction/repulsion** are treated as a **useful decomposition** in many systems (cohesive vs dispersive constraints), not as a universal claim that all forces literally come in pairs.

### 2.2 Effective Force: What the System Can Actually Learn/Absorb

Not every influence contributes to stable structural change. FIT distinguishes **effective** forces from noise:

A force component ($F^{(i)}$) is “effective” relative to a system’s update mechanism if it measurably shapes state updates:

$$
\mathrm{MI}\!\left(F^{(i)};\Delta I \mid I\right) > \kappa
$$

and/or if a model inside or outside the system can predict $\Delta I$ from $F^{(i)}$ better than a null baseline.

This avoids conflating “energy present” with “structure formed.”

### 2.3 Information (I): Decision‑Relevant Structure with Persistence

FIT uses “information” in a practical sense: structure that is (a) accessible to the system (or embodied in the system’s dynamics), (b) participates in decision/update rules, and (c) persists long enough to influence future trajectories.

A minimal persistence proxy is:

$$
\mathrm{Persist}(I;\tau) \triangleq \int_0^\tau w(u)\,\mathrm{MI}(I_t; I_{t+u})\,du
$$

Interpretation: if a pattern cannot be retrieved/expressed downstream, it is not information in the FIT sense—it is transient configuration.

### 2.4 Time (t): Horizons and Time‑Scale Matching

Time is not merely “duration.” FIT emphasizes **time scales**:

* $\tau_F$: characteristic time scale of force/constraint change
* $\tau_I$: characteristic time scale of information update/adaptation
* Structural adaptation is favored when **some** update mode satisfies:

$$
\exists k:\; \tau_I^{(k)} \approx \tau_F
$$

Within an order-of-magnitude window.

This converts “timing matters” into a testable claim.

## 3. Minimal Layer Criteria (L0–L8)

The L0–L8 ladder is useful only if “layer transitions” are not purely rhetorical. FIT proposes **minimal criteria** for identifying when a system has crossed into a qualitatively new regime of constraint management.

> A “layer” is defined by a new dominant mechanism for generating, storing, and deploying persistent information to manage constraints over a larger scale (time horizon, coordination scope, or counterfactual depth).

### L0: Physics — Constraints Without Persistent Organization (Baseline)

**Criterion:** dynamics largely described by physical laws; persistent structure appears only when constraints allow stable attractors (e.g., bound states).
**FIT focus:** Most perturbations dissipate; only constraint‑consistent patterns persist.

### L1: Chemistry — Stable Patterns and Networks

**Criterion:** formation of stable chemical structures and reaction networks; persistence primarily through energetic favorability and kinetic stability.
**Transition cue:** existence of reaction pathways that repeatedly regenerate certain structures under sustained boundary conditions.

### L2: Life — Heritable Information Across Generations

**Minimal criterion:** an information channel enabling **(i)** replication, **(ii)** heritable variation, and **(iii)** differential persistence under selection constraints.
This is not “complexity” but **persistence of heritable information**.

### L3: Mind — Counterfactual Models Used for Policy

**Minimal criterion:** the system can evaluate multiple candidate futures internally (or quasi‑internally) and use them to select actions, reducing reliance on external trial‑and‑error.
**Operational cue:** planning/imagination is not merely present, but **policy‑relevant**.

### L4: Society — Shared Symbols and Norms for Multi‑Agent Coordination

**Minimal criterion:** stable communication codes and norms that reduce uncertainty among agents and enable coordinated constraint management beyond dyadic interaction.
**Cue:** information becomes externalized: language, norms, roles.

### L5: State — Institutionalization and Enforcement

**Minimal criterion:** persistent institutions that (i) codify rules, (ii) enforce constraints, and (iii) sustain coordination at scale through legitimacy, coercion, or incentive design.

### L6: Civilization — Transgenerational Persistence of Values and Systems

**Minimal criterion:** structures (values, paradigms, infrastructures) that constrain choices across generations, coordinating long‑horizon resource allocation and knowledge accumulation.

### L7: AI — Non‑Biological Information Substrate for Constraint Absorption

**Minimal criterion:** a non‑biological system that can learn/update policies and representations, interacting with human institutions and infrastructures to absorb/manage civilization‑scale informational and strategic constraints (e.g., overload, coordination complexity, time compression).

**Important non‑teleological note:** AI is not asserted as inevitable; rather, under certain constraint regimes, externalized information substrates become strongly favored.

### L8: Meaning/Governance Closure — The Governance of Objectives Becomes a First‑Class Adaptive Mechanism

This is intentionally framed as an open layer with strict guardrails.

**Minimal criterion (engineering‑safe form):** the system includes an explicit, auditable mechanism for updating objectives/constraints **within a governance loop**, rather than relying on static external goals alone.

This does **not** imply unconstrained self‑generated values. It implies that in high‑complexity regimes, objective specification and constraint enforcement must be treated as adaptive system components—**with oversight**.

## 4. Key Propositions (Conditioned, Falsifiable)

FIT’s value increases when stated as testable propositions rather than universal slogans.

### P1 (Effective Force): Learnability Predicts Structural Gain

**Claim:** When the mutual information (or predictability) between constraint signals and internal updates approaches zero, long‑run structuralization efficiency decreases toward zero.
**Falsifier:** demonstrate persistent structural gains with no measurable coupling between constraints and updates.

### P2 (Persistence): Long‑Horizon Performance Tracks Persistent Information

**Claim:** In tasks requiring long horizons, performance is bounded by a persistence measure of decision‑relevant information, not by transient complexity.
**Falsifier:** show robust long‑horizon performance without persistent retrieval of task‑relevant information.

### P3 (Time‑Scale Matching): Resonance Windows Exist

**Claim:** there exists a parameter region where adaptation is maximized when an update mode matches the force time scale.
**Falsifier:** show no degradation when $\tau_I \ll \tau_F$ or $\tau_I \gg \tau_F$ across a broad range without adding compensating modes.

### P4 (Boundaries/Modularity): Boundary‑Respecting Systems Generalize Better Under Composition

**Claim:** when the environment has factorized structure, modular representations and narrow interfaces improve stability and compositional generalization.
**Falsifier:** show consistent superiority of fully entangled architectures under the same factorized task structure and comparable capacity.

### P5 (Counterfactual Planning): Simulation Reduces External Trial Cost

**Claim:** when external trial is costly, policy‑relevant counterfactual simulation reduces required environment interactions for the same performance.
**Falsifier:** show planning provides no sample‑efficiency advantage in regimes where accurate models and verification channels exist.

### P6 (Governance Closure): Static Exogenous Objectives Become Fragile Under Autonomy and Distribution Shift

**Claim:** as systems become more autonomous and operate over longer horizons under shifting environments, purely static external objectives increase instability risk (misoptimization, fragmentation, unintended amplification).
**Falsifier:** show stable, long‑horizon, open‑world autonomy under fixed objectives without governance adaptation and without escalating failure modes.

## 5. Measurement Proxies (Minimal “Scorecard”)

FIT is intended as a diagnostic tool; below are simple proxies:

* **Effective force:** $\mathrm{MI}(F;\Delta I\mid I)$, prediction error of $\Delta I$ from $F$, gradient signal‑to‑noise
* **Persistence:** memory half‑life, retrieval accuracy over delay, $\mathrm{Persist}(I;\tau)$ proxy
* **Time matching:** performance vs $\log(\tau_I/\tau_F)$ sweep
* **Modularity:** cross‑module coupling (MI/causal influence), compositional generalization score
* **Counterfactual:** environment interactions to reach threshold performance, correction latency after verification
* **Governance:** violation rate under distribution shift, auditability, rollback effectiveness, objective‑update traceability

---

## 6. Boundary Conditions and Non‑Claims

FIT should explicitly avoid overclaiming:

1. **Non‑teleology:** FIT does not assert that evolution has a goal; it only models constraint‑driven transitions.
2. **Non‑determinism:** FIT predicts pressure for change, not a unique future structure. Path dependence and historical contingency remain central.
3. **Domain mapping caution:** “force” differs across domains; FIT uses a unifying abstraction, not an identity claim.
4. **Modularity is conditional:** when the underlying task structure is not decomposable, forced modularity can harm performance.
5. **Meaning/governance is not value relativism:** “meaning closure” is framed as governance‑loop adaptation with oversight, not unrestricted self‑authored values.

---

## 7. Why FIT Matters (A Practical Use Case)

FIT is best used as a structured set of questions:

1. **What constraints are acting here (and how are they changing over time)?**
2. **What information structures absorb/manage these constraints?**
3. **How persistent are these structures, and do their update time scales match the constraint dynamics?**
4. **Where are boundaries, interfaces, and failure containment?**
5. **Can the system cheaply simulate and verify alternatives?**
6. **Is there an auditable governance loop for updating objectives and constraints under shift?**

When the answer to one of these is “no,” FIT predicts increased likelihood of instability, inefficiency, or forced restructuring.

---

## Final Thought (Reframed)

The world does not necessarily move forward by choice; it often moves forward when existing structures fail to satisfy constraints over relevant horizons. FIT does not predict the next destination. It provides a disciplined way to recognize when constraint pressures are accumulating—and what types of structural adaptations are most plausible.
